This project is all about finding insights and the effect of the covid on the mental health of women during pregnancy. This analysis considers many factors like maternal age, household income and education to study the depression, anxiety and health of the baby. It groups women according to age and household income and finds how differently they are affected by depression and anxiety. It also studies the effect of depression
and anxiety on baby's health in terms of baby's height and weight.

## Findings
- If a lady is in the age group 25-38 while conceiving she will not be under any anxiety attacks, moreover, she will also not suffer from any post-pregnancy depression and can take care of herself and her baby more effectively.

- If a female is conceiving beyond the age of 42, this is very risky for the baby as there are very high chances of pre-mature birth of the baby and the pre-mature birth may be in less than 7.5 months of gestation periods.

- Females falling in the age group of 25-42 are less worried about the impact of covid-19 on them and their new born health. They are less worried as compared to females who conceived less than 25 and females who conceived after the age of 45. its also evident that females after the age of 43, are more worried about the impact of covid-19 on their babies. It may be due to high anxiety and post-pregnency depression in this age group

- After the age of 38, there is a notable 13%[28-41%] increase in the likelihood of women requiring a c-section rather than opting for a natural delivery. this statistic underscores the physiological changes associated with maternal age and their implications for childbirth.

- On testing the relationship between maternal age and [ will the new born need intensive medical supervision after birth , healthy or unhealthy weight, healthy or unhealthy height] ,by hypothesis testing , it was found that there is a significant association between the age of pregnant women and the likelihood of NICU_Stay and babe having unhealthy weight, however there is no evidence for significant association between age and height of new born.

- High anxiety , depression , premature birth can be reason for admission of babe to NICU after delivery.
